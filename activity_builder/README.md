- **Detailed Analytics**: Heart rate zones, speed variability, elevation profiles

### 🔍 Semantic Search
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for intelligent similarity search
- **Natural Queries**: Search using natural language (e.g., "challenging climb", "high heart rate")
- **Smart Matching**: Finds activities based on context, not just keywords
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line, interactive terminal, and web interface

### 🌐 Web Interface
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with gradient backgrounds
- **Real-time Search**: Instant results with detailed activity information
- **Smart Suggestions**: Pre-built query chips for common searches
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Collection overview and activity breakdowns

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Docker Environment
```yaml
Services:
- ChromaDB: Vector database on port 8001
- Python App: Analytics engine on port 5000

📁 data/              # Analysis outputs
📁 scripts/           # Shell scripts
📁 reports/           # Generated reports
```

**Key Files:**
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `launcher.py` - Interactive launcher for all tools
- `src/core/interactive_analyzer.py` - Core analyzer with AI integration

```

### Command Line Search
```bash
# Using Docker
cd docker && docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec python-app python main.py

# Or run examples directly
python examples/search_demo.py
```

### Web Interface

```

### Direct Analytics
```bash
# Run story generation
python src/core/story_generator.py

# Or use the interactive analyzer
python src/core/interactive_analyzer.py
```

## 📈 Sample Insights

### Stream Data Coverage
- **Heart Rate**: 86.8% of activities with detailed HR zones
- **GPS Tracking**: 98.6% of activities with route information
- **Speed Analysis**: Real-time pace variations and performance metrics

### Activity Distribution
- **Rides**: 140 cycling activities
- **Runs**: 1 running session  
- **Walks**: 3 walking activities
- **Effort Levels**: 39 easy, 102 moderate, 3 hard intensity

### Search Capabilities
- "challenging climb mountain bike ride" → Returns activities with significant elevation
- "high heart rate intense workout" → Finds activities with HR >140 bpm
- "morning workout easy pace" → Locates relaxed morning sessions
- "winter cycling cold weather" → Discovers cold weather activities

## 🎨 Natural Language Stories

The system generates rich, contextual stories like:

> "A 30.3km cycling ride with 200m of climbing at an average speed of 16.3 km/h and an average heart rate of 142 bpm. Took place on a cool morning in summer. Maintained a steady pace throughout. Heart rate data shows consistent effort. GPS tracking captured detailed route information."
